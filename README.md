# üèóÔ∏è Integrated System Reconnaissance & Analysis Toolkit

A multi-phase **engineering systems project** that simulates an environment, performs automated reconnaissance, and studies system behavior through traffic capture and analysis. The toolkit highlights **workflow design, automation, and performance evaluation** skills that are widely applicable across engineering disciplines.

## Overview

This project is divided into three main phases:

### Part 1 ‚Äì Environment Preparation and Baseline Reconnaissance
- Identified system parameters including local VM IP and subnet.  
- Initialized the environment with PostgreSQL-backed services.  
- Conducted a baseline scan to discover active hosts and enumerate open services.  

### Part 2 ‚Äì Workflow Automation
- Developed a reusable automation script (`scan.sh`).  
- Automated environment checks and data collection processes.  
- Collected logs and traffic data during scans to validate repeatability.  

### Part 3 ‚Äì Data Capture and Analysis
- Captured traffic flows in real time to study system behavior.  
- Applied filters to separate connection attempts, rejected traffic, and accepted traffic.  
- Examined packet-level details to understand flow efficiency and system responses.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how **engineering methods ‚Äî defining, measuring, analyzing, and improving systems ‚Äî** apply in a technical environment. By building a reproducible workflow, automating measurements, and analyzing system responses, I gained experience in the type of structured problem-solving that is critical across all areas of engineering.
