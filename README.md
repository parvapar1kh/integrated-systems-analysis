# üèóÔ∏è Integrated Systems Simulation & Traffic Data Analysis Toolkit

This project demonstrates how engineering principles of **measurement, automation, and analysis** can be applied to study system behavior in a controlled environment. The toolkit simulates a networked system, automates repeatable checks, captures traffic data, and evaluates performance patterns ‚Äî highlighting skills that are directly relevant to civil and transportation engineering.

## Project Overview

The project progresses through three phases:

1. **Environment Setup & Baseline Measurements**  
   - Built a controlled Linux VM environment to represent an engineered system.  
   - Established baseline conditions and documented active connections and services.  

2. **Workflow Automation & Data Capture**  
   - Created a reusable script (`scan.sh`) to automate environment checks and logging.  
   - Standardized data capture to reduce error and ensure reproducibility.  
   - Collected time-series traffic data for later analysis.  

3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Analyzed captured data to evaluate flow patterns and identify bottlenecks.  
   - Applied filters to separate accepted vs. rejected traffic.  
   - Produced charts and summaries to support engineering-style recommendations.

## Tools & Methods

- Linux Virtual Machines for controlled simulation  
- Bash scripting (`scan.sh`) for workflow automation  
- Traffic monitoring tools for data collection  
- CSV and plotting utilities (Python/Excel/Matplotlib) for analysis and visualization

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Automation:** streamlined workflows for reproducibility and efficiency  
- **Measurement:** established baselines and collected traffic/flow data  
- **Analysis:** processed results to assess system performance  
- **Communication:** documented methods and results in a professional, engineering-focused style

## Engineering Relevance

This project reflects the core engineering workflow:  
**define ‚Üí measure ‚Üí test ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí recommend.**

The same approach is used in civil and transportation engineering, such as traffic studies, infrastructure monitoring, and system capacity evaluation. By simulating flows and analyzing patterns, this project shows how to apply structured, data-driven methods to solve real-world engineering problems.
