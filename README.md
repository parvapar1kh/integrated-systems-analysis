 # 🏗️ Integrated System Reconnaissance & Analysis Toolkit

A multi-phase **engineering systems project** that simulates an environment, automates reconnaissance, and studies system behavior through traffic capture and analysis. The focus is on **workflow design, automation, reproducibility, and data-driven evaluation** — skills that are valuable across engineering disciplines, from civil infrastructure to IT systems.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is divided into three phases:

### Part 1 – Environment Preparation & Baseline Reconnaissance
- Configured a controlled VM environment and documented baseline parameters.  
- Initialized supporting services and confirmed system connectivity.  
- Performed a structured scan to identify active hosts and catalog available services.  

### Part 2 – Workflow Automation
- Developed a reusable script (`scan.sh`) to standardize environment checks.  
- Automated logging and traffic monitoring to ensure repeatable results.  
- Combined scanning and monitoring to observe system response under load.  

### Part 3 – Data Capture & Analysis
- Collected and examined packet-level traffic in real time.  
- Applied filters to distinguish between attempted, rejected, and accepted connections.  
- Interpreted results to understand flow efficiency and overall system behavior.
